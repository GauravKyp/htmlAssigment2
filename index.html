            HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language.Basically&#44; it&#146;s
            the &#34;code&#34; behind every webpage &#45; even this one. If
            you&#146;re just beginning to learn HTML&#44; let us tell you that
            it&#146;s a fairly easy task. HTML&#44; without styling, can&#146;t
            do anything more than setting a layout&#44; drawing a table&#44; or
            creating frames &#45; but it is handy as it helps you structure the
            content correctly&#44; which is important when you sit down to add
            style to your HTML&#46;
          </p>

          <div>
            <img
              src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001486.jpeg"
              alt="error"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            However simple this might seem&#44; it is a mighty useful tool when
            it comes to full-fledged web development&#46; Various tools easily
            eliminate the HTML coding from your work process &#45; but if you
            want to be in full control of your web-page&#44; you&#146;ll need to
            have some command over HTML&#46;
          </p>

          <p>
            Through this article&#44; we aim to give you the essential HTML
            building blocks that&#146;ll help you get up and running&#46;
            Reading this&#44; you&#146;ll be able to understand an HTML source
            code and even modify it for your own good&#33;

          <h3>Step One &#45; TAGS</h3>
          <div>
            <img
              src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001485.png"
              alt="error"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            Tags are what you&#146;ll see the most when you look at any HTML
            source code&#46; A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any item
            on your HTML document&#46; Tags tell what magic is to be done on the
            content enclosed by them&#46;
          </p>
          <p>Let&#146;s look at two types of tags&#58;</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                &#60;tag&#45;example&#45;1&#62;I need a closign
                tag&#60;tag&#45;example&#45;1&#62;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &#60;tag&#45;example&#45;2/&#62; I don&#39;t need a cloding
                tag&#46;
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            In the first example&#44; the sentence is wrapped by two tags&#46;
            The first one is called the opening tag and the second one is called
            the closing tag&#46; Everything in between is affected by the
            properties of the tag&#46; Very commonly used examples of such tags
            are &#60;html&#62;&#44; &#60;head&#62;&#44; &#60;body&#62;&#44;
            &#60;strong&#62;&#44; etc&#46;
          </p>

          <p>
            The second example tags about loner tags &#45; as in&#44; they
            don&#146;t need a closing tag to function&#46; Although it&#146;s
            not required&#44; these type of tags are often written as
            &#60;tag&#47;&#62; to make the debugging of code easier&#46; Common
            examples of such tags are &#60;hr&#47;&#62; &#45; used for
            horizontal line&#44; &#60;br&#47;&#62; &#45; to break the line&#44;
            etc&#46;
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>
            Step Two &#45; HTML&#44; HEAD&#44; and BODY&#58; The three pillars
            of your document
          </h3>
          <div>
            <img
              src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001488.jpg"
              alt="Error"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
            These tags are essential for any HTML document&#46; They parcel out
            the significant parts of your HTML code&#46;
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                &#60;BODY&#62; &#60;&#47;BODY&#62; is placed below your
                &#60;HEAD&#62; tag&#44; and everything that you want to be
                displayed on your screen comes under this tag&#46; Text&#44;
                images&#44; links&#44; and pretty much anything you can see in
                your browser live inside this tag&#46;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &#60;HTML&#62; &#60;&#47;HTML&#62; wraps your entire code&#44;
                Everything else in your HTML document needs to come inside these
                tags&#44;
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                &#60;HEAD&#62; &#60;&#47;HEAD&#62; includes things like
                title&#44; styles&#44; and scripts&#46; Head is usually present
                at the top &#40;hah&#33;&#41;&#44; just inside the
                &#60;&#47;HTML&#62; tag&#46;
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Now that you know how to set up the skeleton of your document&#44;
            let&#146;s proceed with the things that will go inside your
            &#60;BODY&#62; tag and do some magic&#33;
          </p>

          <p>Some basic text formatting tags &#58;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              &#60;li&#62;&#60;b&#62; &#60;&#47;b&#62; makes your text look
              <b>bold</b>&#60;&#47;li&#62;
            </li>
            <li>
              &#60;li&#62;&#60;i&#62; &#60;&#47;i&#62; makes you write in
              <i>cursive</i>&#60;&#47;li&#62; &#60;li&#62;
            </li>
            <li>
              &#60;u&#62; &#60;&#47;u&#62; <u>underlines</u> what you just
              wrote&#60;&#47;li&#62;
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>For example&#44; this piece of code</p>

            fret too much about the &#60;br&#47;&#62; &#46; It&#146;s just for
            breaking the line so that you can start from the next line&#46;
            Enter key does little when it comes to changing lines in your HTML
            document&#46;

              Note&#58; you need to use these tags as space and enter keys do

          <p>
            HTML provides you with six tags&#44; from &#60;H1&#62;
            &#60;&#47;H1&#62; to &#60;H6&#62; &#60;&#47;H6&#62; to help you
            create different sized headers quickly&#58;

          <h3>Inserting an Image&#58;</h3>
          <p>
            All that&#146;s good&#44; but what fun without images on the
            webpage&#63; Don&#146;t worry&#44; &#60;IMG&#47;&#62; to the
            rescue&#33; The image tag has a mandatory attribute called
            &#34;source&#34;&#46; Basically&#44; it tells the browser where it
            should look for the image&#46; The syntax goes something like&#58;
          </p>

          <p><i> &#60;img src = “path_to_your_image” &#47;&#62;</i></p>
          <p>
            Furthermore&#44; it also has attributes like height and width that
            let you specify the height and width you want your image to
            take&#46;
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Lists&#58;</h3>
          <p>
            HTML has two types of lists &#45; ordered and unordered&#46; Each
            item of your list has to be enclosed in a tag&#46; The syntax for
            creating a list is fairly simple&#46;
          </p>
          <p>Suppose you want to create a list like&#58;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Item 1</li>
            <li>Item 2</li>
            <li>Item 3</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The following code will easily do the job for you&#58;</p>
          <hr />

          <pre>
&#60;ul&#62;
  &#60;li&#62; Item 1  &#60;&#47;li&#62;
  &#60;li&#62; Item 2 &#60;&#47;li&#62;
  &#60;li&#62; Item 3 &#60;&#47;li&#62;

          <br />
          <p>
            This&#44; by the way&#44; was an example of an unordered list&#46;
            For an ordered list&#44; all you need to do is replace &#60;ul&#62;
            with &#60;ol&#62; and &#60;&#47;ul&#62; with &#60;&#47;ol&#62;&#46;
          </p>
          <p>Let&#146;s see what the following code does&#58;</p>
          <hr />
          <pre>
&#60;html&#62;
      
  &#60;head&#62; &#60;&#47;head&#62;

     &#60;ul&#62;
      &#60;li&#62;I am unordered list&#146;s item 2&#33;&#60;&#47;li&#62;
      &#60;li&#62;I am unordered list&#146;s item 1&#33;&#60;&#47;li&#62;
      &#60;li&#62;I am unordered list&#146;s item 3&#33;&#60;&#47;li&#62;
      &#60;li&#62;I am unordered list&#146;s item 4&#33;&#60;&#47;li&#62; 
    &#60;&#47;ul&#62;

    &#60;ol&#62;
      &#60;li&#62;I am ordered list&#146;s item 1&#33;&#60;&#47;li&#62;
      &#60;li&#62;I am ordered list&#146;s item 2&#33;&#60;&#47;li&#62;
      &#60;li&#62;I am ordered list&#146;s item 3&#33;&#60;&#47;li&#62;
      &#60;li&#62;I am ordered list&#146;s item 4&#33;&#60;&#47;li&#62;

            All of these tags&#44; when arranged coherently&#44; will provide
            you with a simple webpage consisting of images&#44; headings&#44;
            and lists&#46; Further&#44; there are various tags that HTML
            supports&#44; and we thoroughly recommend you to check them out and
